This led me to dive deeper into how these soft factors were managed during periods of change.</p>\n<p>One of the key factors I felt was contributing to this lack of oversight of soft factors was the lack of visibility across the organisation about what was changing, who was impacted, and when they were impacted. Traditional Organisational Change Management tools aim to solve this by asking the right questions, however the execution was poor. Often tools and templates stored in Excel or Word documents - filled in once, never to be looked at again. Hence, Sortd was born - a place to get an enterprise wide view of change.</p>\n<p>I look forward to sharing this journey with you.</p>\n<p>Scott Waddell (CEO &#x26; Founder)</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":{"zh_CN":"Why I Started Sortd","en_US":"Why I Started Sortd"},"order":5,"type":"August 2019"},"fields":{"path":"\\blog\\0819\\why-i-started-sortd.en-US.md","slug":"/blog/0819/why-i-started-sortd","modifiedTime":1565668120400,"avatarList":[{"href":"/scotty595","text":"\n        scotty595\n","src":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/19480825?s=40&amp;v=4"}]}},"allMarkdownRemark":{"edges":[{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":{"zh_CN":"Why I Started Sortd","en_US":"Why I Started Sortd"},"order":5,"type":"August 2019","time":"2019-08-13T00:00:00.000Z"},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/0819/why-i-started-sortd","path":"\\blog\\0819\\why-i-started-sortd.en-US.md"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blog/0819/why-i-started-sortd","type":"/blog/"}}}
