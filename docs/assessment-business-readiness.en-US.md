## What is a Business Readiness Assessment?

This tool is designed to help clarify the change issues associated with a particular project. It takes a forward look at issues for project-related changes.

Utilising a simple workshop focussed design, it enables businesses to quickly identify areas requiring attention and to effectively mitigate risks.
