## Change is the new normal 
(Source: IBM Making Change Work 2008)

Today’s dynamic work environment is causing organizations to reframe the traditional view of what “normal” is. We are witnessing the effects of globalization, technology advances, complex multinational organizations, more frequent partnering across national borders and company boundaries – just to mention a few of the enablers and accelerators of change.

No longer will companies have the luxury of expecting day-to-day operations to fall into a static or predictable pattern that is interrupted only occasionally by short bursts of change. to prosper, leaders will need to abandon such outdated notions of change. In reality, the new normal is continuous change – not the absence of change.

Change masters have realised that behavioral and cultural change is crucial to project success and is considerably tougher to address than the so-called ‘hard’ factors, such as structure, performance measures and incentives.

Practitioners place a key responsibility for successful change right at top management’s door.
