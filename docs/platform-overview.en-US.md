## What is Sortd?

At a high level, Sortd is a platform which provides a variety of integrated tools and templates enabling organisations undergoing change to effectively manage change. 

## Structure

The basic structure of Sortd is as follow:
```
- Organisation
    - Project A
        - Change 1
            - Activities
        -Change 2
            - Activities
    - Project B
        -Change 1
            - Activities
```

The above structure enables a variety of reporting, tracking, and permission benefits.


### Organisation

The Organisation is the highest level in the Sortd structure. 

### Project

According to PMI a project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service or result. Sortd has therefore taken the approach to structure all changes under a project. A project is required prior to creating a change.

When setting up a project, users are asked to set up the Project Management Lifecycle and the change activities which are required at each stage.

### Change

When your organization undertakes projects or initiatives to improve performance, seize opportunities or address key issues, they often require changes; changes to processes, job roles, organizational structures and types and uses of technology. Each project can contain multiple changes, and each change can contain mulitple activities.

### Activities

Activities are the key weapon in Sortd's arsenal. Each change may have multiple activities depending on the exact requirements of the project. 

The key activities in Sortd are:

- High Level Change Impact Assessment
- Change Impact Assessment
- Business Readiness Assessment
- Stakeholder Assessment
- Change Management Plan
- Benefits Realisation Assessment
- Communications Assessment
- Training Needs Analysis
