Many organisations struggle (or are not even trying) to build their internal organisational change management capability, often relying on external consultants to save troubled projects or simply not seeing the expected return on investment. To help address this struggle, Sortd has developed the Sortd Organisational Change Maturity Model, a detailed model based on 4 key areas assessed using practical real life examples and supported by the Sortd Organisational Change Management Platform.

By setting goals and tracking progress towards them, organisations are able to truly see the value created when change is successfully executed.

# Areas of Focus

## Vision & Leadership

This area focuses on ensuring the necessary vision & leadership are present within the organisation. Are the right sponsors in place? Is communication delivered consistently and in the right format? Is organisational change management seen as a priority or a necessity? 

## Usage

This area focuses on assessing how organisational change management is used within the organisation. 

## Skills

This area focuses on ensuring the people within the organisation are supported with the right skills and training to excel at embeddeding and maintaining change.

## Consistency

As the late Anthony Bourdain once said:
> We learn as professionals by repetition, by getting it wrong, getting yelled at and doing it again.

Maybe we can skip the getting yelled at part, but the principle remains the same. As it's name suggests the key focus of this area is ensuring that change management efforts are done in a consistent coordinated manner, enabling organisations to change, learn, and repeat. Is organisational change management present throughout the organisation or isolated in certain pockets? Is organisational change management integrated with the organisations project management framework? Is organisational change management reported on, and actively improved?
