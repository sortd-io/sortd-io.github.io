> It is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change -Charles Darwin

The inspiration for Sortd started in 2014 when as a fledgling Management Consultant, I started to see a pattern in organisations undertaking change – there was a heavy focus on hard factors (ensuring training is organised, implementing new KPI’s, ensuring the organisational structure is correct, etc), but little focus on the soft factors (Employee involvement, top management sponsorship,  culture change, etc). This led me to dive deeper into how these soft factors were managed during periods of change.

One of the key factors I felt was contributing to this lack of oversight of soft factors was the lack of visibility across the organisation about what was changing, who was impacted, and when they were impacted. Traditional Organisational Change Management tools aim to solve this by asking the right questions, however the execution was poor. Often tools and templates stored in Excel or Word documents - filled in once, never to be looked at again. Hence, Sortd was born - a place to get an enterprise wide view of change.

I look forward to sharing this journey with you.
